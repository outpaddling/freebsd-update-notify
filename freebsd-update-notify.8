.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.B freebsd-update-notify
is a script, normally run by cron(8), that checks for available
base system updates (downloaded by freebsd-update(8)) and for elapsed
time since the last successful updates performed by
auto-update-system(8).

If updates have been downloaded by freebsd-update cron, or sufficient
time has elapsed since the last successful auto-update-system (according
to the "max-days-between-updates" in
etc/freebsd-update-notify/freebsd-update-notify.conf), a popup
message is displayed on the console asking the user if they would like
to perform updates.

If the user clicks "Yes", then
.B auto-update-system --defaults
is run, to update installed packages, ports, and the base system.

If the user clicks "No", the time is recorded to
/usr/local/etc/freebsd-update-notify/last-reminder, and the next
notification will occur in the number of hours specified in
the "hours-between-reminders" entry in
/usr/local/etc/freebsd-update-notify/freebsd-update-notify.conf.

A sample crontab file is installed in
/usr/local/etc/freebsd-update-notify/freebsd-update-notify.crontab.sample,
and copied to /usr/local/etc/cron.d/freebsd-update-notify if the latter
does not already exist.  Users can edit
/usr/local/etc/cron.d/freebsd-update-notify to change the schedule for
running freebsd-update-notify downloads and checks.
See crontab(5) for details about the crontab file format.

Other configuration options are found in
/usr/local/etc/freebsd-update-notify/freebsd-update-notify.conf,
which can also be edited to customize behavior.

.SH BUGS
The current implementation (a shell script using zenity) has limitations.
For example, there is no way to disable keyboard input, so if a notification
window pops up and grabs the keyboard while the user is typing,
the user may inadvertently answer the dialog with a random keystroke.
The best solution to this problem is reimplementing freebsd-update-notify
as a standalone X11 app with full input control.
